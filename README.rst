**This is an alpha release. Do NOT use on uncommitted code!**

`fstringify` is a command line tool to automatically convert a project's Python code from old "%-formatted" strings into Python 3.6+'s "f-strings".

Here's a `complete diff running it against flask <https://github.com/pallets/flask/compare/master...jacktasia:fstringified>`_.


## About
========

I mainly wanted an excuse to play with the built-in `AST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tokenize.html) and [tokenze](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tokenize.html) modules. That said, f-strings are really cool. To quote Joanna Jablonski's great [f-string guide <https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/>`_ and `tokenze](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tokenize.html) modules. That said, f-strings are really cool. To quote Joanna Jablonski's great [f-string guide <https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/>`_ modules. That said, f-strings are really cool. To quote Joanna Jablonski's great `f-string guide <https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/>`_:

> Not only are they more readable, more concise, and less prone to error than other ways of formatting, but they are also faster!

## Installation
===============

`fstringify` can be installed by running `pip install fstringify`.  It requires

Python 3.6.0+ to run and effectively turns the code it runs on into Python 3.6+,

since 3.6 is when "f-strings" were introduced.


## Usage
========

To run: `fstringify {source*file*or_directory}`


## Command line options
=======================

```

usage: fstringify [-h] [--verbose | --quiet] [--version] src

fstringify 0.x.x

positional arguments:

  src         source file or directory

optional arguments:

  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

  --verbose   run with verbose output

  --quiet     run without output

  --version   show version and exit

```

## Other Credits / Dependencies / Links
=======================================

- `astor <https://github.com/berkerpeksag/astor>`_ is used to turn the transformed AST back into code.
- `black <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_ was a big inspiration, but is only used as a dependency for forcing double quotes when they are used as the input code.
